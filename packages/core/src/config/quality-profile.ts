 *   the {@link EvidenceCoordinator} spawns per page. `0` disables the
 *   coordinator entirely and the drafter falls back to its own tool calls.
 * - `forkWorkerConcurrency` — upper bound on in-flight worker executions.
 * - `maxRevisionAttempts` — how many times a page may be re-drafted after a
 *   reviewer returns `verdict: revise`. `0` means no retries.
 * - `drafterMaxSteps` — `stepCountIs(...)` budget for drafter drafter.
 * - `reviewerMaxSteps` — `stepCountIs(...)` budget for reviewer.
 * - `reviewerVerifyMinCitations` — number of citations the reviewer MUST
 *   verify with the `read` tool. `0` disables the verification requirement.
 * - `reviewerStrictness` — tone setting for the reviewer system prompt.
 * - `askMaxSteps` — `stepCountIs(...)` budget for AskStreamService (chat
 *   assistant). Covers page-first and page-plus-retrieval routes.
 * - `workerMaxSteps` — `stepCountIs(...)` budget for each worker
 *   evidence-collection subtask.
 * - `researchMaxSteps` — `stepCountIs(...)` budget for each research
 *   planner/executor LLM call (per sub-question in the executor).
